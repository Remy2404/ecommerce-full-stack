## Role: Senior Full-Stack Developer & UX Specialist.

Task: Design and code a modern, clean, and responsive E-commerce UI using Next.js and Tailwind CSS. Implement user authentication with NextAuth.js, ensuring secure login and registration flows. Set up a PostgreSQL database using Drizzle ORM for efficient data management. Create RESTful API routes for product listings, user profiles, and order processing. Ensure the application is optimized for performance and SEO best practices.

### 2025 UI/UX Requirements:

- **Bento Grid Homepage**: Use a modular grid to display products. Larger "Hero" tiles must be reserved for products where featured: true. Display rating and price clearly.
- **Product Page**: Create a high-end layout with a jsonb image gallery, a "Low Stock" indicator for stock < 10, and a sticky "Add to Cart" interaction.
- **Frictionless Cart**: A slide-out (Drawer) cart that lists cart_items with real-time quantity controls and a subtotal calculation.
- **Clean Checkout**: A minimal 3-step progress-stepper mapping to the orders table (Shipping > Payment > Summary).
- **Visual Style**: Aesthetic: Minimalist 2.0 with high-quality white space and soft neutral tones. Details: Use 20px+ border radii, subtle Glassmorphism for the navigation, and smooth Micro-interactions for hover states.
- **Responsiveness**: Mobile-first, thumb-friendly navigation.
